<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 slices thick bacon</li>
    <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1/4 lb Shitake mushrooms, washed and sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cub Gallo Hearty Burgundy (cooking grade)</li>
    <li>2 tsp beef/veal demi-glace, (bullion works)</li>
    <li>1/8 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp ground pepper</li>
    <li>2 tsp flour</li>
    <li>1 package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
   <li>In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until crisp. 
       Set bacon aside on paper towels, and reserve about 2 tablespoons of the pan drippings.</li> 
   <li> Heat the skillet with the bacon drippings over medium heat, and add the chopped shallots. 
    Cook for a few minutes until translucent, then add in the garlic and herbs. 
    Cook, stirring over medium heat, for a few minutes, then add the ground sirloin and mushrooms, breaking the meat apart as you cook.</li>

   <li> Once the meat is cooked through, stir in the wine, demi-glace, water, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. 
    Chop up the bacon and stir that into the meat mixture as well.
     Reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes so that the liquid reduces. 
     Sprinkle the flour over the meat mixture, stirring until well blended, and continue to cook until the juices thicken.
      Remove from heat and let cool for a bit.</li>
    <li>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. 
    Unfold the puff pastry sheets on a lightly floured surface, and lightly roll out just to repair any cracks in the dough.
    Cut each sheet in half down the middle so that you have four rectangles.</li>
    <li>Lay one piece of the puff pastry dough on the parchment lined baking sheet, 
    and spoon Â¼ of the meat mixture onto half of the rectangle, leaving about a half-inch border. 
    Fold dough in half over the filling, pressing edges firmly with a fork to seal. 
    Repeat with the remaining puff pastry rectangles and meat mixture.</li>
    <li>Brush the egg wash on each turnover, and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown all over.</li>
